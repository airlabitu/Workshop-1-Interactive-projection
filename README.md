Resources for the AIR LAB workshop #1: Interactive projections:

On October 4th 2019, AIR Lab at ITU Copenhagen will be hosting a creative coding workshop, where we will be working with Kinect body tracking sensors and Processing to program and create interactive projections. Everyone is welcome, and people of all skill levels can participate.

Please have the latest version of the Processing IDE installed (download link: https://processing.org/download/), and if you are new to Processing (or coding in general), you can get a head start by completing however much you want of the following tutorial: https://hello.processing.org/editor/ 

Happy coding!
